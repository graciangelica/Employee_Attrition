# Employee_Attrition

The goal of this project is to use machine learning to predict which employees may quit the company.

## Description

HR team has gathered some data and wants to predict which employees may quit the company, so they can control employee attrition. There are two sets of data, Employees Data Base and Last Evaluation of Employee Satisfaction.

## Output of the project

After cleaning the datasets, I train and test them with various machine learning algorithms. And it shows that the best classifier for this project is RandomForest with 99% accuracy. It means the machine could predict very well, and HR team can make predictions on which employees that will leave.
